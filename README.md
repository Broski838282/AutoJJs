- Set `KeepSky = true`
- Adjust `MaxRenderDistance` to a higher value

**Still experiencing lag:**
- Run the Ultra Performance Addon
- Enable `LowEndDeviceMode = true`
- Reduce `ParticleLimit` and `MaxRenderDistance`

**Important objects disappeared:**
- Enable `SafeMode = true`
- Check the `EssentialObjects` whitelist
- Restore from backup settings if available

### Performance Not Improving?

1. **Check System Requirements**: Ensure your device meets minimum requirements
2. **Close Other Applications**: Free up system resources
3. **Update Graphics Drivers**: Ensure you have the latest drivers
4. **Try Ultra Mode**: Use the addon script for maximum optimization
